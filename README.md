# Platform Engineering Coding Assignment



## Assignment:

In order to help showcase your full-stack talents, weâ€™re asking you a create and deploy a small service that allows a user to collect images and gifs from a web URL, and view them on a web page.

We encourage the use of

* Google Cloud Platform's free tier or similar for deploying your work
* Your choice of preferred languages, tools, frameworks, libraries and services
* Microservices Architecture

To help organize the prompt we'll evaluate the project in 3 parts:

#### Part 1:

Write an endpoint that takes a valid public Url as input and outputs a JSON payload with at least the following information:

* The webpage that was scraped
* A list of assets on the webpage with the name of the file and the source url

Bonus points for additional file types or meta data of your choosing.

#### Part 2:

Create a simple webpage that presents the user with a input field for collecting a Url, and uses the service from Part 1 to display the collected assets to the user.

Again, feel free to use whatever tools, or frameworks you see fit, and take whatever creative liberties with the prompt you'd like.
